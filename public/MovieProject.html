<h1>Jordin's Perfect Movie List</h1><p>
<h2>The Perfect Trifecta of Movies</h2><hr />
<h2>Shrek 2</h2>
<p>Shrek is a masterpiece, but its sequel will forever have my heart.</p>
<h2>Across The Spiderverse</h2>
<p>This is the most beautiful movie from plot, to art, to soundtrack it is perfect.</p>
<h2>The Hunger Games</h2>
<p>This one is a classic for me and also stars my first and still favorite celebrity crush, Jennifer Lawrence</p>
